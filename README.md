# Portfolio/Blog Website

The purpose of this website is to tell the visiters a little about myself, collect and display any projects that I take part in, contain my resume, and provide where people can contact me.

I have goals to add fun Javascprit features as I learn them in Code Louisville.

## So Far...

So far I am designing this site with the mobile first approach so that it will be responsive to mobile layouts as well as the standard PC layouts.
